<blockquote>
<p>It’s my birthday. I’m 68. I feel like pulling up a rocking chair and dispensing advice to the young ‘uns. Here are 68 pithy bits of unsolicited advice which I offer as my birthday present to all of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the things that resonated with me at the time of writing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.</li>
<li>A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.</li>
<li>Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.</li>
<li>Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.</li>
<li>Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.</li>
<li>The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.</li>
<li>Promptness is a sign of respect.</li>
<li>If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.</li>
<li>To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.</li>
<li>Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.</li>
<li>Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.</li>
<li>You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.</li>
<li>There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with.</li>
<li>Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.</li>
<li>On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first, bypassing the cities. You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in the remote, and then later you’ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back.</li>
<li>When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.</li>
<li>How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.</li>
<li>Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.</li>
</ul>
