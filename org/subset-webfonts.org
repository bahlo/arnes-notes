#+title: Subset Webfonts

- tags :: [[file:web-development.org][Web Development]], [[file:fast-webfonts.org][Fast Webfonts]]

* The problem
Webfonts can have relatively large sizes. [[https://typeof.net/Iosevka/][Iosevka]] for example (the typeface that I use for code on this website) is 660kb for one font.

* The solution
You can subset your fonts, i.e. generate a font with /only/ the glyphs you need. With font subsetting I was able to reduce the size of Iosevka from 660kb to 12kb.

* How to
1. Install [[https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger][glyphhanger]] with npm
2. Install ~fonttools~, ~brotli~ and ~zopfli~ with pip
3. Start your local server (you can skip this if you want to use a remote target)
4. Call glyphhanger with the remote target and your base font.

Glyphhanger will start a headless Chrome, load your page(s), determining the glyphs you need.

I cannot recommend using the ~--spyder~ argument as it didn't seem to work for me, but that would be the easiest solution as it follows links from the inital page up to 10x.

Instead for my website I'm using the command to subset Iosevka (~http://localhost:1313~Â  is the address of the local [[file:hugo.org][Hugo]] server):
#+begin_src sh
glyphhanger $(curl -s http://localhost:1313/sitemap.xml | grep loc | sed 's/\s*<loc>//' | sed 's/<\/loc>//' | tr '\n' ' ') --family="iosevka web" --formats=woff2,woff --subset="./fonts/iosevka-*.ttf"
#+end_src

It's a bit hacky ngl, maybe I will propose a change to the tool to parse the sitemap itself.

Check out my [[https://github.com/bahlo/knowledge/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml][GitHub Actions workflow]] for a real-world example with [[https://rsms.me/inter/][Inter]], Iosevka and [[file:hugo.org][Hugo]].
