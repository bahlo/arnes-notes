We want to be able to stack cards when scrolling down. Check out the website of [[https://corey.ginnivan.net][Corey Ginnivan]] for an example.

Create your cards in CSS as you would otherwise.

Then add the following CSS:
#+begin_src css
.card {
  position: sticky;
  top: 10px;
}
#+end_src

This will lead to cards stopping at 10px from the top and the following cards to float over them.

For the offset you want to change ~top~ for each card. You can either do that manually like this:
#+begin_src css
.card:nth-child(1) {
  top: 10px;
}

.card:nth-child(2) {
  top: 20px;
}

.card:nth-child(3) {
  top: 30px;
}

/* and so on */
#+end_src

If you use [[file:sass.org][SASS]], you can create a for loop like this to simplify things:
#+begin_src scss
@for $i from 1 through 10 {
  .card:nth-child(#{$i}) {
    top: $i * 10px;
  }
}
#+end_src
