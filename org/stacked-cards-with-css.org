#+TITLE: Stacked Cards with CSS

If you want to implement stacked cards, there's a [[https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/][great guide by CSS-Tricks]] on how to achieve this.

We want to be able to stack cards when scrolling down. Check out the website of [[https://corey.ginnivan.net][Corey Ginnivan]] for an example.

First, create your cards in [[file:css.org][CSS]] as you would otherwise.

Then add the following CSS:
#+BEGIN_SRC css
.card {
  position: sticky;
  top: 10px;
}
#+END_SRC

This will lead to cards stopping at 10px from the top and the following cards to float over them.

For the offset you want to change ~top~ for each card. You can either do that manually like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC css
.card:nth-child(1) {
  top: 10px;
}

.card:nth-child(2) {
  top: 20px;
}

.card:nth-child(3) {
  top: 30px;
}

/* and so on */
#+END_SRC

If you use [[file:sass.org][SASS]], you can create a for loop like this to simplify things:
#+BEGIN_SRC scss
@for $i from 1 through 10 {
  .card:nth-child(#{$i}) {
    top: $i * 10px;
  }
}
#+END_SRC
