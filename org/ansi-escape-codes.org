#+TITLE: ANSI Escape Codes

When you work in the terminal (e.g. on [[file:unix.org][Unix]]), having colors and text formatting often improves the user experience.

There is a great post on Stack Overflow called [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/33206814][List of ANSI color escape sequences]] which goes into detail on all supported escape codes.

Here is a basic selection:

| Code                   | Usage                    |
| ----                   | ----                     |
| \033[1m                | Bold                     |
| \033[3m                | Italic                   |
| \033[4m                | Underline                |
| \033[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m | Set RGB foreground color |
| \033[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m | Set RGB background color |
                         |                          |

There's [[https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728][a list of terminals]] that support RGB, most importantly Terminal.app and Hyper don't support it while [[file:iterm2.org][iTerm2]], Alacritty and PuTTY support it (check the link for an exhaustive list).
