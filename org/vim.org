#+TITLE: Vim

Vim is a texeditor. The name comes from Vi IMproved as it is a clone (with additions) of vi, a text editor program for Unix. It was release to the public in 1991.

* Modes
Vim has 6 basic modes:

- Normal mode :: the default mode, used for editor commands
- Visual mode :: like normal mode, but can highligh areas of text and editor commands will run on that highlighted text
- Select mode :: like visual mode but if you enter a printable character, carriage return, new line or line feed Vim will insert the character and start insert mode
- Insert mode :: similar to editing in most editors
- Cmdline mode :: supports a single line at the bottom of the window for commands
- Ex mode :: similar to Cmdline mode but on completion it prompts for another Ex command (you almost never want this mode)
