WCAG are the Web Content [[file:accessibility.org][Accessibility]] Guidelines.

If you're [[file:web-development.org][developing a website]], please check the quick reference linked above.

Here are the most basic points:
- All non-text content needs to have a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
- Text needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- All functionality of the content needs to be operable through a keyboard
- There needs to be a mechanism to bypass blocks of content that are repeatet on multiple web pages
- Prefer native elements over fancy JS
- Prefer special html element over ~div~ (i.e. ~main~ or ~nav~)
