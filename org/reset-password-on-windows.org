#+TITLE: Reset Password on Windows
#+DATE: 2021-08-31

So you forgot your Windows passwort? This is how you can fix it:

* Prerequisites
- No full disk encryption (BitLocker)
- No online account (use the Microsoft services to reset the password)

* Reset
1. Download the latest edition of the =Offline NT Password & Registry Editor= at [[https://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/][pogostick.net]] (click on =Bootdisk= and scroll to =Download=). If you have another Windows computer available, you can do the USB stick version although the site notices that CDs are more reliable
2. Burn/copy the software to a CD/USB stick
3. Make sure your BIOS can boot from the medium (search the for a guide for the specific vendor)
4. Start Windows, click =Restart= but enter the BIOS on restart. Doing a shutdown actually doesn't really shut down in most cases on modern systems (it's called [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/shut-down-sleep-or-hibernate-your-pc-2941d165-7d0a-a5e8-c5ad-8c972e8e6eff][hibernation]]).
5. Boot from the medium and follow the instructions to reset the password ([[https://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/][the walkthrough]] is apparently outdated but worked great in my case).
   I recommend clearing the password as that's supposed to be most reliable.
6. Boot windows again and login!
