#+title: NRZ (Non-return-to-zero)

- tags :: [[file:signal-processing.org][Signal Processing]]

NRZ line code is a binary code in which ones an zeros are represented by a significant condition and no netural or rest condition.

* Variants
| Code name | Complete name               | Description                                                                             |
|-----------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NRZ(L)    | Non-return-to-zero level    | Raw binary bits without any coding. Typically binary 1 maps to high and binary 0 to low |
| NRU(I)    | Non-return-to-zero inverted | Either NRZ(M) or NRZ(S)                                                                 |
| NRZ(M)    | Non-return-to-zero mark     | 0 maps to constant, 1 maps to toggle                                                    |
| NRZ(I)    | Non-return-to-zero space    | 0 maps to toggle, 1 maps to constant                                                    |
| NRZ(C)    | Non-return-to-zero change   | ?                                                                                       |

* Advantages
NRZI is used because is easier to detect a transition at high speeds than measure exact voltage.

* Example
You can see how the NRZI signal is translated to binary. A change in the signal results in a 1, no change results in a 0:
