#+TITLE: Remove an element from a slice in Go

Since [[file:golang.org][Go]] slices don't have a ~remove~ method or anything similar you need to do it yourself.
Stack Overflow has a [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37334119/how-to-delete-an-element-from-a-slice-in-golang][great thread]] on the best ways to achieve this, summarized here:

* Order matters
If you need to retain the order, use this logic:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
func remove(slice []int, s int) []int {
	return append(slice[:s], slice[s+1:]...)
}
#+END_SRC

This is inefficient because you may end up moving all elements, so only do this if you need to keep the order.

* Order is not important
If you don't care about the order it is much faster to swap the last element with the one to delete and return a slice without the last element.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
func remove(s []int, i int) []int {
	s[i] = s[len(s)-1]
	return s[:len(s)-1]
}
#+END_SRC
