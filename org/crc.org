#+title: Cyclic redundancy check

- tags :: [[file:signal-processing.org][Signal Processing]]

An error-detecting code commonly used in networks and storage devices to detect accidental changed to raw data. The check value is based on the remainder of a polynomial division of the data.

They are called CRCs because the /check/ value is a /redundancy/ and the algorithm is based on /cyclic/ codes.

CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in hardware, easy to analyze and good at detecting common errors cause by noise in transmission channels.
