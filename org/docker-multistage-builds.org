#+TITLE: Docker multi-stage builds

You probably don't need the whole language toolchain in your [[file:docker.org][Docker]] container.
If you still want to use Docker to build you can use so-called multi-stage builds ([[https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build][official documentation]]).

* Example
This is an example for a [[file:golang.org][Golang]] application:
#+BEGIN_SRC Dockerfile
FROM golang:1 AS builder
COPY /app /
WORKDIR /app
RUN go build -o /bin/app ./app

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
COPY --from=builder /bin/app .
CMD ["./app"]
#+END_SRC
