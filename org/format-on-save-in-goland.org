#+TITLE: Format on save in Goland

If you use [[file:goland.org][Goland]], you most likely want to format on save, here's how:

1. Open Settings and go to Tools -> Filewatchers
2. Click =+= and choose either =gofmt= or =goimports= (whatever you prefer)

That's it! This should be the default in my opinion.
