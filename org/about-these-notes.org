#+title: About these notes

Hey, I'm [[https://arne.me][Arne Bahlo]] and these are my notes.

I try to collect my knowledge and I'm adding new notes almost every day.

Check out the [[/index][Index]] with all notes, alternatively here's a small selection of good entrypoints:

- [[file:software-engineering.org][Software Engineering]]
- [[file:sysops.org][SysOps]]
- [[file:wisdom.org][Wisdom]]
- [[file:philosophy.org][Philosophy]]
- [[file:leadership.org][Leadership]]

The source of this wiki is available on GitHub: [[https://github.com/bahlo/arnes-notes][bahlo/arnes-notes]]. If you want a personal wiki like this but don't know how to build it, let me know, I'll happily help you find a solution: [[mailto:hey@arne.me][hey@arne.me]].
