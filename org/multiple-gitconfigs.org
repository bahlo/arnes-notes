#+TITLE: Multiple Gitconfigs

If you use the same computer for both personal and work [[file:git.org][git]] repositories, you probably want to use a different email address for each.

One solution for this is having multiple ~.gitconfig~ files that override each other based on the directory you're in.

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Developer/work/"]
  path = .gitconfig-work
#+END_SRC
