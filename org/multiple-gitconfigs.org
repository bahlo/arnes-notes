#+TITLE: Multiple Gitconfigs

- tags :: [[file:git.org][Git]]

You can have multiple ~.gitconfig~ files that override each other based on the directory you're in.
This is especially useful if you use a different Email for work commits.

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Developer/work/"]
  path = .gitconfig-work
#+END_SRC
