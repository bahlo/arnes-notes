#+title: Darkmode in CSS

- tags :: [[file:css.org][CSS]], [[file:web-development.org][Web Development]] 

You can use the following ~@media~ query to detect system dark mode.
In this example we use a dark background for dark mode:
#+begin_src css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background: #000;
  }
}
#+end_src

I personally like to combine this with [[file:css-custom-properties.org][CSS Custom Properties]] to make the switch as seamless as possible.

Note that as of the writing of this post Internet Explorer (and some other minor browsers) did not support this query. Check yourself: [[https://caniuse.com/prefers-color-scheme][Can I use prefers-color-scheme media query]].
