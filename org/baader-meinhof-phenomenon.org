* Why is it called the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It all started in the comments section of a newspaper called the Minnesota St. Pauls Pioneer Press. During the 90s, one commenter talked about the Baader-Meinhof group, which was a West German terrorist organization, and within hours, he saw another reference to the group 70 years after the organization was disbanded. Hence, the term was coined as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.
