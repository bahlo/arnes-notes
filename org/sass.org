SASS (or SCSS) is a preprocessor for [[file:css.org][CSS]].

* SASS vs. SCSS
** SCSS
SCSS uses the file extension ~.scss~ and is a superset of CSS (with a few exceptions), which means *all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well*.
** SASS (The Indented Syntax)
This was the original syntax and uses ~.sass.~. It doesn't use curly braces but instead relies on intentation.

* Advantages over CSS
** Nesting
Instead of writing this in CSS:
#+begin_src css
header a {
  color: red;
}

header h1 {
  color: blue;
}
#+end_src

you can write the following:
#+begin_src scss
header {
  a {
    color: red;
  }
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
}
#+end_src

This vastly improves the readability of CSS files.
** And more
There's a /lot/ of features that make SASS super powerful, check out [[https://sass-lang.com/documentation][the documentation]] for more information.
