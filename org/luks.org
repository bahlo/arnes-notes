#+TITLE: Luks

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) is a full disk encryption specification for [[file:unix.org][Unix]] systems (originally intended for Linux only).
It allows you to easily create an encrypted volume.

* Install
On Ubuntu/Debian, run: ~apt-get install cryptsetup~.

** Set up
Run the following to create an encrypted volume on ~/dev/sdb~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb
#+END_SRC

Please note that this delete the contents of ~/dev/sdb~.

After that, open the volume and create a file system:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cryptsetup open /dev/sdb encrypted
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted
#+END_SRC

** Open and mount
Open the volume and then mount it (in this case to ~/mnt/data~):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cryptsetup --type luks open /dev/sdb encrypted
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted /mmt/data
#+END_SRC

**  Unmount and close
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ umount /mnt/data
$ cryptsetup close encrypted
#+END_SRC
