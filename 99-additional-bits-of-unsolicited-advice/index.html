<blockquote>
<p>I have another birthday, and another bunch of unsolicited advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the things that resonated with me at the time of writing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>That thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult — if you don’t lose it.</li>
<li>If you have any doubt at all about being able to carry a load in one trip, do yourself a huge favor and make two trips.</li>
<li>Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.</li>
<li>It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.</li>
<li>If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure.</li>
<li>Be governed not by the tyranny of the urgent but by the elevation of the important.</li>
<li>In all things — except love — start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of.</li>
<li>Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.</li>
<li>The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility.</li>
<li>A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.</li>
<li>If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.</li>
<li>To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy.</li>
<li>Be the change you wish to see.</li>
<li>Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift.</li>
<li>If you borrow something, try to return it in better shape than you received it. Clean it, sharpen it, fill it up.</li>
<li>Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever.</li>
<li>When someone tells you something is wrong, they’re usually right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong.</li>
<li>Avoid hitting the snooze button. That’s just training you to oversleep.</li>
<li>Always say less than necessary.</li>
<li>Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.</li>
<li>Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.</li>
<li>You can reduce the annoyance of someone’s stupid belief by increasing your understanding of why they believe it.</li>
<li>If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.</li>
<li>All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.</li>
<li>I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I did.</li>
<li>The greatest teacher is called “doing”.</li>
<li>A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem.</li>
<li>When you are stuck, sleep on it. Let your subconscious work for you.</li>
<li>Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.</li>
<li>This is the best time ever to make something. None of the greatest, coolest creations 20 years from now have been invented yet. You are not late.</li>
<li>Every person you meet knows an amazing lot about something you know virtually nothing about. Your job is to discover what it is, and it won’t be obvious.</li>
<li>Always give credit, take blame.</li>
<li>Be frugal in all things, except in your passions splurge.</li>
<li>When making something, always get a few extras — extra material, extra parts, extra space, extra finishes. The extras serve as backups for mistakes, reduce stress, and fill your inventory for the future. They are the cheapest insurance.</li>
</ul>
